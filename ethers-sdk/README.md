# template-npm
A template for building, publishing and maintaining npm packages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Setup ‚ö†Ô∏è

Please read carefully this section as it describes how to properly set up the repository once you've forked this
template.

There are a few things you **need** to change and know before adding your own code:
1. Change the `name`, `version`, `description`, maybe the `author` and the `license` fields in the `package.json`
file.
2. This template forces you to use the [conventional-commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
3. In order for the releaser to work properly, you must set the `NPM_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` secrets in your fork.
   1. Both of these can be found/generated respectively [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens)
   and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
   2. Triggering releases is done by pushing code to the main branch. Versioning will be managed by the semantic-release
   GitHub action, which you can learn more about [here](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#how-does-it-work).
4. You must uncomment the last step in the `.github/workflows/release.yaml` file.

## How does it work ?

Describe how the project works in a few sentences.
- Give a Layman description of the project.
- Show some schemas if required.
- How some of the project's dependencies help.

## Getting started !

### Installing from npm
```shell
yarn add <package_name>
```

### Quickstart

Below is a quick example of the package usage:
```typescript
// Creates the base provider.
const parentProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
    'https://fittest-sleek-log.discover.quiknode.pro/YOUR_TOKEN_HERE/'
);

// Creates a Quick Node provider using the parent provider's context.
const qnProvider = new QuickNodeProvider(parentProvider);

const res = await qnProvider.fetchNFTCollectionDetails([
   '0x2106C00Ac7dA0A3430aE667879139E832307AeAa',
]);

console.log(res)
```

Which should print:
````shell
[
  {
    name: 'Loopy Donuts',
    description: 'Loopy Donuts',
    address: '0x2106C00Ac7dA0A3430aE667879139E832307AeAa',
    genesisBlock: 13145256,
    genesisTransaction: '0xcd0d897674123c1859c406b4e14f8a1a6dd5b8b8161bc7563d012e950a26301d',
    erc721: true,
    erc1155: false
  }
]
